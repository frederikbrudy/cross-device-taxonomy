  "contribution_desc": "The paper presents a system enabling cross-device browsing. A user's browsing history is captured on all of their devices and securely stored on a remote server to make it available on all other devices. Apart from collecting URLs only, the paper also proposes a heuristic-based approach to extract salient features of a visited website alongside its URL (i.e., title and header of a page, a salient image, and the text surrounding the salient image). The paper also briefly describes how devices in different form factors should best display the browsing history.",
