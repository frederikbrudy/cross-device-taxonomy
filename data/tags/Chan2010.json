IR cameras detect invisibly projected markers on the tabletop.\r\n\r\nThe tabletop uses diffused illumination for touch recognition. \r\n\r\nA custom-built desk lamp uses a pico projector and IR camera to project high resolution images onto the tabletop relative to the position it is pointing to.\r\nHandheld tablet devices can augment the view on the tabletop data (e.g. 3D imagery of a city map).\r\nA handheld \"flashlight\" can be used to project details on the table at a given position.",
