  "contribution_desc": "HuddleLamp is a low-cost sensing technology that enables spatial and cross-device interactions using off-the-shelf mobile devices. It uses a commodity RGB-D camera to track location and orientation of devices put on a table. A novel Hybrid Sensing approach fuses RGB tracking and depth confidence tracking to compensate for drawbacks of RGB-only tracking (e.g., overhead lights that cut through device contours or different device bezel colors). It detects mobile screens by exploiting their optical characteristics in the IR range and additionally using RGB images and fiducial markers to better track screens and to distinguish them from other objects or users' hands. Also, HuddleLamp applications are web applications and thus do not require installing any additional software or applications.",
