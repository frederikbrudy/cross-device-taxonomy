Data can be output to phones, desktop/laptop computers and smart TVs. Smarcos is studied in a two week deployment with diabetes patients. The paper furthermore evaluate the Continuous Care and Coaching Platform (C3PO), a system that combines 3D-accelerometer based sensors with smartphones and a web portal.",

  "crossdevice_def": "\"The fact that this coaching system is a multi-device system has a number of consequences. First of all a multi-device service system is able to combine the advantages of single device feedback systems and brings them together on one integrated service platform. It allows users to have multiple contact points in various contexts: at home, at work and on the road. A multi-device system is able to gather more context information of the user compared to a single-device system and it can combine this information to present better feedback to the user.\""
