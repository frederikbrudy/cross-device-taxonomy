It is a distributed activity-centried information management system. Active work setup across all connected devices (e.g. laptop, tablet, smartphone) is visualized on a tabletop display. Through multi-touch gestures, the setup can be reconfigured and data can be transferred between devices. \r\n\r\nThrough a scenario-base user evaluation, the perceived usefulness as well as usage of ActivitySpace for cross-device tasks was evaluated.
