  "contribution_desc": "The paper describes findings of multiple studies with older people about their smartphone usage. While not necessarily in the centre of our taxonomy, the paper has some interesting findings about \"cross-device interaction\": Older people prefer to use smartphones on the go, but at home they prefer to switch to other devices, such as laptops, desktop PCs, or tablets as they are used to those, they have larger screens, better input modalities, etc. \r\n\r\nFurther their unterstanding of \"cross-device interaction\" is relevant.

  "crossdevice_def": "\"at home [older people] are more prone to jumping between devices for ergonomic reasons, thus, cross-device interactions are key for this group.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cross-device interaction is common nowadays both in research and in commercial products, e.g by making the data accessible through different devices, (e.g. Chrome, Dropbox). However, more effort is required in terms of cross-device tasks. Namely the transition of one task between two devices often could be simplified; e.g. the process of starting an email (or any other task) in the smartphone and finish it in the computer can be simplified. This could be achieved by synchronizing the current display of the (email) interface, or by allowing users to remotely control [...]\"."
