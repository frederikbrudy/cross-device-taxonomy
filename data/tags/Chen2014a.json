Based on the devices' spatial configurations, Duet coordinates their motion and touch input, and extends their visual and tactile output to one another. This transforms the watch into an active element that enhances a wide range of phone-based interactive tasks, and enables a new class of multi-device gestures and sensing techniques.\"\r\nThe \"technical evaluation demonstrates the accuracy of the new gestures and sensing techniques used by Duet, and a subjective study on the Duet system provides insights, observations, and guidance for future work towards a symphony of interaction\".",
