  "crossdevice_def": "\"Research on mobile collocated interactions has sought to push the boundaries of how mobile devices are perceived by users and designers, attempting to evolve them from devices purposed for distributed interactions solitarily performed by individuals to communicate, to devices which can be be used to encourage engaging collocated interactions [7,18]. This work has supported the evolving nature of interacting with mobile devices from personal/individual toward shared/multiuser experiences and interactions [12], allowing people to use their mobile devices as artefacts in their everyday activities and interactions [15].\"\r\n\r\n",
