  "contribution_desc": "The authors describe \"TerraGuide, a novel multi-surface environment for exploratory terrain analysis\". TerraGuide displays a terrain across three different displays as 2D top-down view of a terrain on a tabletop display; a panoramic view on a wall display behind the tabletop; and a 3D terrain view in a handheld tablet device. The views are synchronized across the devices. \r\n\"central contribution is to show how interaction techniques on multiple surfaces can be designed to allow fluid, combined use of multi-surface techniques and easy change between these techniques.\"",
