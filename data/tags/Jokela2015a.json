The spectrum of devices covered is interesting (e.g., SatNav, Game Consoles, Cameras, etc. besides the usual like phone and tablet)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We analyze 123 real-life multi-device use cases and identify the main usage patterns, including Sequential Use, Resource Lending, Related Parallel Use, and Unrelated Parallel Use. We discuss the practical challenges of using several information devices together. Finally, we identify three levels of decisions that determine which devices are used in a particular situation, including acquiring, making available, and selecting the devices for use.\"",
