It compares three different forms of interaction: direct touch, phone as a tangible control physically on the tabletop, and phone as a remote control (through the user interface) away from tabletop.\r\n\r\nContribution: \"cross-device interaction\" -> \"study\" -> \"usability & user experience\" -> \"remote control\"\r\n\r\nStudy measures: \"task time\", \"task accuracy\", \"subjective workload\", \"social acceptability\", \"practicality/usefulness\"",
