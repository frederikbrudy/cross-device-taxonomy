  "crossdevice_def": "\"Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets were originally conceived and have traditionally been utilized for individual use. Research on mobile collocated interactions [6][11][16] has been looking at situations in which collocated users engage in collaborative activities using their mobile devices, thus going from personal/individual toward shared/multiuser experiences and interactions\"\r\n\r\n\"Several researchers have explored mobile collocated interactions, encouraging people to share their devices to create a collective experience or reach a common goal. Various physical and social contexts of use have been taken into account, such as teamwork at the office [7] (Figure 2), sharing media content at home [8] (Figure 3) and outdoors [3] (Figure 4), public expression in a theme park [4] (Figure 5) and in a pub [9] (Figure 6), and for sharing educational stories in rural, developing-world contexts [17]. More recently, researchers have been looking into simple ways to bind such devices together [10]. Most of this research has been looking at the use of smartphones (and tablets) to study mobile collocated interactions.\""
