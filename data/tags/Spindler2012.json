  "contribution_desc": "This paper introduces the concept of Tangible Windows: head-perspective paper displays that act as peepholes into a virtual 3D information space or serve as tangible containers and are controlled by physically moving them through the volume on or above a tabletop surface. The paper contributes the design space of head-perspective multi-display interaction, where the tabletop is the global display and projection-based paper displays as local displays and personal views into the global display. It also proposes 3D interaction techniques for scene and object exploration and manipulation on the global display through local displays.\r\n\r\nContribution: \"cross-device interaction\" -> \"design space\" -> \"paper-based display + tabletop\" -> \"3D scene/object exploration and manipulation\"",
