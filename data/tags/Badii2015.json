Users can now and frequently do comment on or rate TV shows or search for related information about characters, places or objects appearing in them [1]. They can follow updates of their friends regarding shows, can participate actively and be part of wider social communities in the context of a program. This type of usage is known as second screen usage; forecasts predict dramatic growth and impact rates for it even if the initial usage and facilities of second screen are currently still limited [2].\""
