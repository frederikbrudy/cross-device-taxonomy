  "contribution_desc": "The paper presents an interaction technique for 3D exploration of time-series data (3D+t). The user can explore 3D content by moving a mobile device (i.e., a tablet) in space where the content is then presented as \"2D slices\" on the mobile screen. Further, users can bookmark slices for later use. An additional wall-sized screen can display multiple (bookmarked) views of the time-series data, and users can transfer views from the wall-sized screen to the mobile device and vice versa. The mobile device is tracked in 6DOF using an OptiTrack motion capture system to achieve the spatial navigation and exploration. ",
