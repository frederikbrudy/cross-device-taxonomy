The HMD, therefore, extends the output space beyond the mobile device.\r\n\r\nAlso, authors discuss three different alignment modes for how to align the context view (HMD) with the focus view (mobile device). The alignment modes are body-aligned, side-by-side, device-aligned and were studied in a controlled lab experiment.",
