Two ConnectTables connect to each other and build one continious interaction space when brought close together. Content items can be moved between two displays and are seemlessly transferred. \r\n\r\n\"Two ConnecTable displays dynamically form a\r\nhomogeneous display area when moved close to each other. The appropriate triggering signal comes from built-in sensors allowing users to temporally combine their individual displays to a larger shared one by a simple physical movement in space. Connected ConnecTables allow their users to work in parallel on an ad-hoc created shared workspace as well as exchanging information by simply shuffling objects from one display to the other.\"",
