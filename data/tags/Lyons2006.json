The simulation runs on a laptop or Tablet PC, and depicts an environment populated with insect-like creatures that eat, fight, and breed according to a simple rule-based system (see Figure 2). Each \"bug\" possesses its own unique genetic makeup, which gets expressed as different phenotypic traits that can either help or hinder its survival in the ecosystem.\"",
