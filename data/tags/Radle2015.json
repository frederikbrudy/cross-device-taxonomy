  "contribution_desc": "This cross-device paper presents a gesture elicitation study and a controlled experiment that explore the user preference of spatially-aware and spatially-agnostic cross-device interaction techniques. Spatially-aware interaction techniques are preferred because they match users' spatial awareness but only when they reduce cognitive load and mental switching (e.g., edge bubbles outperformed radar view). Spatially-agnostic interactions are popular for cross-device object movement when the number of devices is small and their spatial configurations are static. Synchronous gestures are popular for expanding views and pairing devices.",
