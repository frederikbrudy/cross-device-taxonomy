A technique is presented for creating adaptable multi-device user interfaces using Java Server Pages (JSP) where a regular web page can be turned into a (pre smartphone) mobile interface.",

  "crossdevice_def": "\"Many researchers and practitioners have identified the need for adaptive, multi-device user interfaces (Amoroso, and Brancheau, 2001; Grundy and Zou, 2002; Han et al, 2000; Van der Donckt et al, 2001). These systems provide user interfaces that can be used across platforms and/or display devices e.g. an interface that will run on both a conventional desktop web browser but also on a PDA or mobile phone device. This allows developers to design and implement a single interface that may be run and provide a userful interface on many different devices (some whose characteristics may be unknown to the developers).\""
