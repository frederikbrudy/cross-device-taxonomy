This paper studies tablet-centric zone-based input from a smartphone, where the phone moves around, horizontally, or vertically near the tablet. The information visualization on the tablet would change given such zone-based input (e.g., moving the mobile device horizontally below the tablet to explore a time series information visualization).",
