  "contribution_desc": "This paper first reports a co-design study (I believe it's similar to participatory design workshop) about knowledge workers' (scientists) practices of access, organization, and interpretation of digital information in mixed individual and collaborative settings. A tabletop-centric prototype is developed to mititgate information silos (digital information distributed across applications and devices) and project silos (knowledge understanding and sharing). The paper then discuss two major findings from studying collaborative use of the prototype: (1) decoupling of documents and content and (2) recomposition of information. It discusses the design of an information architecture that support flexible content management across devices and applications in collaboration and sense-making.\r\n\r\nContribution: \"Study\" -> \"usage patterns, practices\" -> \"information handling\" -> \"individual and collaborative\"\r\n\r\nFeature: \"Study-inspired system\"",
