  "contribution_desc": "The paper contributes XDStudio, a GUI builder that allows developers to interactively create cross-device web interfaces.\r\nXDStudio allows to develope multi-device interfaces either in a simulated authoring environment, where devices are emulated on one screen; and an on-device authoring mode, where conntected physical devices are used to display and develope interfaces. \r\nXDstudio allows users to switch between the two modes as well as between a design- and use-mode. \r\n\r\nDevices are declared through distribution profiles, which describe the device's capability. Profiles can be associated with user roles. \r\n\r\nXDStudio was tested in a lab study with 12 participants. ",
