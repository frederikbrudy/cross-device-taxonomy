  "contribution_desc": "This paper presents a non-voice acoustic recognition system on smartwatches. It describes one application of cross-device (between smartphone and smartwatch) data transfer using a \"sip\" and \"puff\" input. I have decided to tag this paper, because it presents a novel cross-device interaction technique.",
