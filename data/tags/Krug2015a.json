Not only single users are working with multiple devices, also multiple users (teams) are working on collaborative tasks using more and more devices in parallel. Therefore, web applications should support the combination of multiple -- especially mobile -- devices into one consistent user experience. We call these applications distributed web applications. They are defined as applications that can be used on multiple devices and that work on a shared context at the same time.\""
