The study demonstrates that CollectionDiver makes search easier to understand, promotes active approaches to search, has a transparent process and facilitates a shared experience. The CollectionDiver employs a horisontal search display with tangible filter tokens and a vertical result display. The study was conducted in-situ at the library.",
