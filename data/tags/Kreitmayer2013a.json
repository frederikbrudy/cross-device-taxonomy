The system is developed through a participatory design method with educators and is tested in-the-wild in the classroom. The paper discusses findings about supporting both small in-group collaboration and whole-class discussion through shared tablets and a public display, as well as the overall engagement, learning, and practices of collaborative and social skills.\r\n\r\nContribution: \"cross-device\" -> \"collaborative activities in the classroom\" -> \"technology and engagement\"\r\n\r\nFeature: \"Study-inspired system\"; \"all-in-one: design-system-study\"",
