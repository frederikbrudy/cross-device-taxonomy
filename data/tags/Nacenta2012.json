Users can launch and control multiple applications (Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, Flickr and more) from the table and share their view on the vertical display. The results of the study show that there was quite a lot of activity on the table and the most popular uses were showing maps, photos and videos during conversations. Most often participants did not interact with the system simultaneously. ",
