  "contribution_desc": "This paper presents the prototype of a mobile projector device (smartphone) to enable multi-user touch interaction and collaboration on surfaces. The device consists of a private display and a public projection. It enables ad hoc spatial configurations of mobile devices and projection spaces, as well as interaction techniques for supporting cross-device user interface distribution and data transfer. The paper also discusses the technical requirements and challenges in building such device.",
