The system is inspired by how programmers use real world tools (e.g. books, printed pages) to for their work. The authors aim to replicate / support a desk setup with multiple different spaces to be utilized. \r\n\r\nThe programmer can use command line input to display pages (a page is displayed on one screen) navigate the text on pages. \r\n",
