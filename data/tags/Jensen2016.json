The iPads were connected using pinch gesture (using JuxtaPinch) and therefore knew their relative location to each other. \r\n\r\n\"different strategies for solving the task of finding Waldo either by systematically discussing what to do (these had few device interactions), while others would rush through the photos to find Waldo (these had many interactions).\" \r\n\"... four approaches seemed dominant for our participants namely divide ownership of devices, divide interactions, turn-taking, and driver/navigator\"",
