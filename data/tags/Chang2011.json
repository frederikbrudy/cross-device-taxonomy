  "contribution_desc": "The paper presents two interaction techniques, deep shooting and deep posting, to move tasks between a computer and a mobile phone by taking a picture of the screen. Secondly the paper presents Deep Shot, a framework for developers to easily adapt their applications to be able to migrate state across devices using the two techniques.\r\nThe usability of the system is evaluated analytically, while experiments are conducted to evaluate the speed performance of the transfer technique, and the reliability of the tracking.
