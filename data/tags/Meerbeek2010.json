The authors present a set of design explorations including an people's experiences with their living rooms. From this data five interaction concepts are presented and the Pipet concept chosen for prototyping. The pipet prototype allows users to suck up images from devices and send them to other displays. The device is implemented using a WiiMote. The Pipet is evaluated in a qualitative lab study and compared against a gyro-based 3D mouse. The Pipet is found to be significantly more fun and useful than the control condition.",
