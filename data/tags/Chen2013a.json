  "contribution_desc": "This paper studies the use of a multi-slate system (United Slates) in an outside-lab deployment (a detailed description of the system and the interactions can be found in [5]. Each deployment lasted for 30-40 hours of work (resulting in approx. 1-month deployments), and each of the seven participants (senior graduate students) used the multi-slate system for their active reading tasks. Various data were collected during the study including a photo diary, logging data, and interviews. Analyses reveal insights into the utility of multi-slate systems (i.e., micro-mobility to compare document content) and cross-document activities such as writing and annotation.\r\n\r\n[5] Chen, N., Guimbretiere, F., and Sellen, A.
