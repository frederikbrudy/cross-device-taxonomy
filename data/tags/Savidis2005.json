The framework supports discovery of nearby devices via Bluetooth, connection to and discovery of services on these devices, as well as UI and IO distribution. \r\n\r\n\"following this scenario, the user carries a miniaturized pocket-size portable processing unit (PPU), without any input/output (I/O) modules, encompassing various user-chosen software applications. Those applications are capable of dynamically detecting the presence of devices within the surrounding environment, and of using those on-the-fly, so as to realize meaningful interaction with the user.\"",
