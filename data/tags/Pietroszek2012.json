More generally, this paper uses a motivating scenario in which cross-device targeting is required despite the lack of network connectivity, specifically, without any visual cues on the targeting device (e.g., smartphones).",

  "contribution_desc": "This paper proposes a non-visual interaction technique called \"spatial correspondence targeting\" in which the user can select content on a targeted surface (e.g., a large display) by finding the relative corresponding spatial position on a targeting surface (e.g., a smartphone), much like how an artist begins to create a painting. A study shows that users could localize targets presented on a large display within 4% of the display area on a smartphone.",
