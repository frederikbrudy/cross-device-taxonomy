Although, this paper doesn't focus on cross-device interaction per se, it presents an interesting interaction where virtual characters move from a PC screen to a tablet when brought nearby.\r\n\r\n\"When the user holds the tablet near the desktop station, a humanoid character walks towards the screen and jumps to the tablet.
