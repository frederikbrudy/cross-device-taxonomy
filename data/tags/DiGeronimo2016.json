  "crossdevice_def": "\"Cross-device applications allow one or more users to distribute the interface and functionality of an application across two or more devices. Such applications generally have one of three purposes: a) enabling a user to expand their screen real estate by exploiting additional co-located devices, b) distributing functionality so that one or more devices act as a controller for content on larger displays, and c) supporting synchronous\r\ncollaboration by sharing information among different users' devices or moving information to a shared display.\""
