  "contribution_desc": "The paper introduces the RELATE interaction model, which allows to pair mobile devices with other devices and devices in their surrounding through discovery of relative positioning of devices. The spatial references of devices are displayed in a visualisation and allow to match network identities with physical identities. \r\nThe tracking technology has been used in prior publication [13] to show devices on a 2D map. In this paper, the authors display relative locations, around the main device's screen to indicate presence, location, and function of other devices around. The user can then interact with them, using direct touch interaction. ",
