  "contribution_desc": "This paper demonstrates the use of a conductive smartphone case with protuberances to determine the relative spatial positions and angles when a smartphone is positioned on top of a horizontal tablet. The smartphone, when held perpendicular to the tablet, can then served as a 3D virtual porthole into the 2D map displayed on the tablet. This paper lacks some depth, but it shows an extremely cool (in my opinion) application of cross-device interaction for extending the screen space.\r\n\r\nContribution: \"System\" -> \"3D visualization\"",
