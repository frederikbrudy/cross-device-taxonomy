It illustrates six different interaction techniques for cross-device card playing and evaluate their usability and usefulness. They conclude that \"natural\" gestures like a wrist-whip that mimicked the physical gesture you would use in playing cards was slower than the other techniques and that the participants found it less useful and less natural.
