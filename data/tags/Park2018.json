It exemplifies the formalization using a meeting scenario with presenter controls, presentation UI, timer, meeting notes, etc.",

  "contribution_desc": "This work contributes an automated UI distribution formulation that takes user roles, device access, UI completeness, user preferences, and device capabilities into account. The formulation is implemented using integer programming and its performance evaluated with respect to increasing number of devices, elements, users, and user+devices. It, further, contributes a designer-in-the-loop tool that allows a designer to test UI distributions at design-time and in real-time. The designer-in-the-loop tool was evaluated in a lab study and contrasted to manual UI distribution.",
