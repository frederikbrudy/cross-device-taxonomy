The authors are particularly interested in how Natural User Interface (NUI) technology can support this type of work.\r\nA setup is designed where multi-touch is compared to mouse, track-pad and leap motion. For the particular setup the multi-touch condition performed the best. For the experiment, a modified Fitts' pointing task is used.",
