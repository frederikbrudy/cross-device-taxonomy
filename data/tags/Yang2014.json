Developers can specify affinity values for each panel and characteristics for each device, which will be used to calculate the optimal distribution of panels across available devices. Panelrama uses integer programming-a linear optimization function-to determine optimal scores for each panel and device and then automatically distributes the panels according to the optimal scores.",
