Here context is how the phone and watch is held, pocketed or placed. The paper identifies 14 contexts, and describes what types of interactions are possible in the given contexts. \r\nThe paper presents a machine-learning based context recogniser, and evaluate the recogniser using different classifiers in a controlled study. An accuracy of up to 90% is achieved.",
