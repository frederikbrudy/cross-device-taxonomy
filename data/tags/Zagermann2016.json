Larger tabletops do not improve collaboration but create distraction. The study (based on the VAST 2006 Challenge [16]) examines the group behaviours and interactions with devices and analyzes the participants interaction with devices, communication activiities, and quality of work as well as users' satisfaction with the the technical system.",
