The authors identify multiple issues with its current implementation under the themes privacy (e.g. when sharing devices with family members), appropriation (fitting the feature into the daily work practice), customization (e.g. selecting only certain apps), awareness (knowing and understanding the feature), exclusion (of older and types of devices) and troubleshooting.",
