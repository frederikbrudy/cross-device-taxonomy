  "contribution_desc": "A general cross-device input framework that allows users to remap functions of an (unodified) application to user-defined gestures. User for example can remap the commands to navigate through a slide deck (i.e. arrow left/right key) to a swipe gesture (i.e. left/right swipe) executed on a touch device.",
