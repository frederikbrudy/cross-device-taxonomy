It can recognize hand gestures and position above / around a tabletop display.\r\n\r\nDevices (e.g. tablets, laptops) within the field of view of the camera can be reognized through attached markers. \r\n\r\nThe authors propose and interaction technique called Lift-and-Drop, which is similar to Pick-and-Drop, but independent from displays. It can be used to transfer content between devices. ",
