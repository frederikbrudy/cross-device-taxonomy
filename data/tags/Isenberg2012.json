One of the key features of the middleware is the separation between the personal data and the applications. This paper is not about interactions but still proposes a relevant architecture for cross-device computing, moving forward from individual devices to systems (vehicles), so I have tagged this paper a \"2\".\r\n\r\nContribution: \"cross-device\" -> \"toolkit, middleware\" -> \"application and data distribution\" -> \"in-vehicle systems\"",
