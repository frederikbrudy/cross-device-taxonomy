  "contribution_desc": "A component-based development framework for distributed user interfaces that focuses on rapid prototyping, distributed and tangible interaction, and service discovery. I have labelled this paper a \"2\", because the system architecture has implications for distributed user interfaces in cross-device interaction (although not explicitly discussed in the paper). This could belong to the category of \"system architecture for distributed user interfaces across devices\". I think there's a difference between DUI work that focus on the distribution of the same user interface to multiple devices to this kind of papers that focus on the distribution of different user interface components to heterogeneous devices (I believe the latter has more relevance to cross-device interaction).",
