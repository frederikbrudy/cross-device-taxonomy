  "contribution_desc": "The paper describes the plans for extending a low-fidelity multi-device prototyping toolkit to enable Wizard of Oz techniques. The existing toolkit (UISKEI) allows to sketch UIs on a tablet interface and record and replay interactions. \r\nUISKEI++ aims to extend this functionality to enable sketching of UIs and behaviour, which can adapt to varying sized and forms of devcies (e.g. tablet, phone, ...). UISKEI++ further allows to sketch behaviour and manipulate it in a Wizard of Oz way.\r\nThe descriptions are purely descriptive about PLANNED worked. ",
