Mid-air gestures and users' positions are tracked via a Kinect, gaze is tracked via an eye tracker. Tactile and auditory feedback is given on the phone once content has been transferred.\r\n\r\nThe second contribution is a study design, where the preparation, halting, and interaction with a public display are factored in.
