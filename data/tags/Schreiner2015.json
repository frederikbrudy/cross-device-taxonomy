Connichiwa allows to create web applications that span multiple devices. It abstracts devcie discovery and cross-device communication away, so developers don't have to implement these themselves.\r\nThrough Bluetooh it also enables auto discovery and rough distance estimation. \r\nDevices can be stitched together with a pinching gesture.
