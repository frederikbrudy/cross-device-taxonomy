They can interact with workspace items with their mouse and keyboard and invoke commands on the editor, menus, etc. \r\nWhile the system in this paper assumes that users are sharing a single screen, the author envision, that the architecture and UI techniques can also be applied to editors shared over a network. \r\n\r\nThis might also be classified as out of scope, as it it \"n people to 1 device\"...",
