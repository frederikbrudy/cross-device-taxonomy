  "contribution_desc": "The paper presents nu-view, a prototype system for co-located collaborative analysis of geospatial disease data. It presents an in-situ study of the system in use with medical specialists. The system supports both coupled and decoupled modes of interaction. Coupled interaction revolves around a large shared display, while decoupled uses personal devices where visualisations can be shared to the shared display.",
