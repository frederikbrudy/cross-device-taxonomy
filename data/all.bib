  abstract = {ABSTRACT Multi-display environments (MDEs) are now becoming common, and are becoming more complex, with more displays and more types of display in the environment. One crucial requirement specific to MDEs is that users must be able to move objects from one display to another; this cross-display movement is a frequent and fundamental part of interaction in any application that spans two or more display surfaces. Although many cross-display movement techniques exist, the differences between MDEs—the number, location, and mixed orientation of displays, and the characteristics of the task they are being designed for—require that interaction techniques be chosen carefully to match the constraints of the particular environment. As a way to facilitate interaction design in MDEs, we present a taxonomy that classifies cross-display object movement techniques according to three dimensions: the referential domain that determines how displays are selected, the relationship of the input space to the display configuration, and the control paradigm for executing the movement. These dimensions are based on a descriptive model of the task of cross-display object movement. The taxonomy also provides an analysis of current research that designers and researchers can use to understand the differences between categories of interaction techniques. }

The multiple-screen layout can be changed dynamically and instantly even while applications are running in each device. This interface can introduce a new kind of interaction: rearrangement of devices triggers a certain reaction of contents. We expect this interface to show great potential to inspire various application designs, and we expect to enrich the contents by offering interaction that a single display or a static multi-display environment cannot provide. To prove and demonstrate that the interface is functional, we implemented a framework for using the interface and developed several applications using it. Although these applications are simple prototypes, they received favorable responses from audiences at several exhibitions.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Synchronous gestures are patterns of sensed user or users' activity, spanning a distributed system that take on a new meaning when they occur together in time. Synchronous gestures draw inspiration from real-world social rituals such as toasting by tapping two drinking glasses together. In this article, we explore several interactions based on synchronous gestures, including bumping devices together, drawing corresponding pen gestures on touch-sensitive displays, simultaneously pressing a button on multiple smart-phones, or placing one or more devices on the sensing surface of a tabletop computer. These interactions focus on wireless composition of physically colocated devices, where users perceive one another and coordinate their actions through social protocol. We demonstrate how synchronous gestures may be phrased together with surrounding interactions. Such connection-action phrases afford a rich syntax of cross-device commands, operands, and one-to-one or one-to-many associations with a flexible physical arrangement of devices. Synchronous gestures enable colocated users to combine multiple devices into a heterogeneous display environment, where the users may establish a transient network connection with other select colocated users to facilitate the pooling of input capabilities, display resources, and the digital contents of each device. For example, participants at a meeting may bring mobile devices including tablet computers, PDAs, and smart-phones, and the meeting room infrastructure may include fixed interactive displays, such as a tabletop computer. Our techniques facilitate creation of an ad hoc display environment for tasks such as viewing a large document across multiple devices, presenting information to another user, or offering files to others. The interactions necessary to establish such ad hoc display environments must be rapid and minimally demanding of attention: during face-to-face communication, a pause of even 5 sec is socially awkward and disrupts collaboration. Current devices may associate using a direct transport such as Infrared Data Association ports, or the emerging Near Field Communication standard. However, such transports can only support one-to-one associations between devices and require close physical proximity as well as a specific relative orientation to connect the devices (e.g., the devices may be linked when touching head-to-head but not side-to-side). By contrast, sociology research in proxemics (the study of how people use the “personal space” surrounding their bodies) demonstrates that people carefully select physical distance as well as relative body orientation to suit the task, mood, and social relationship with other persons. Wireless networking can free device-to-device connections from the limitations of direct transports but results in a potentially large number of candidate devices. Synchronous gestures address these problems by allowing users to express naturally a spontaneous wireless connection between specific proximal (collocated) interactive displays. }
